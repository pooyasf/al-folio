I am a Masters's student of Applied Mathmatics at Sharif University of Technology. Previously I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engenering at Isfahan University of Technology.
Currently I am working at the intersection of Neural Networks and PDEs for my Master's thesis. 

I've put several of my previous projects [here](https://pooyasf.github.io/projects/){:target="\_self"} . 

I love traveling and exploring nature. During these explorations I do analog photography. I love the technical details of doing analog photography. There is a collection of my photos [here](https://pooyasf.github.io/photos/){:target="\_self"}. They were taken while I was travelling different parts of Iran.
