I have a background in Electrical Engeeniering and Mamthmatics. I love modeling nature by Math and trying to understand them using mathmatical toolkits, especially dynammical systems and probability theory . I put several my previous projects [here](https://pooyasf.github.io/projects/){:target="\_blank"} . 

I love traveling and exploring nature. I do analog photography while I am traveling. I love the technical details of doing analog photography. I have put several of my photos [here](https://pooyasf.github.io/photos/){:target="\_blank"}. They are taken while I was travelling different parts of Iran.
