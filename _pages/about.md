I have background in Electrical Engeeniering and Mamthmaics. I love modeling nature by Math and trying to understand them using mathmatics toolkits. Especially dynammical systems and probability theory [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can check out my blog posts here. Also i put several pictures of my previous projects here. 

I love traveling and exploring nature. I do analog photography while i am traveling. There are several of them here exploring Iran. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
