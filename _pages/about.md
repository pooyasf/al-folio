I have a background in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathmatics. Currently I am working at the intersection of deep neural networks and PDEs. I love the way math could help us code (aparently) complicated phenomenons in nature with its simple objects , so we can understand it better. 

I have put several my previous projects [here](https://pooyasf.github.io/projects/){:target="\_blank"} . 

I love traveling and exploring nature. During these explorations I do analog photography. I love the technical details of doing analog photography. There is a collection of my photos [here](https://pooyasf.github.io/photos/){:target="\_blank"}. They are taken while I was travelling different parts of Iran.
