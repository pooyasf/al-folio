I'm a Masters's student of Applied Mathematics at Sharif University of Technology. Previously, I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at Isfahan University of Technology.
I'm mainly interested in Complex Systems (like financial markets), time series analysis, and the application of deep learning in these areas. 

I've put several of my previous projects [here](https://pooyasf.github.io/projects/){:target="_self"} . 

I love traveling and exploring nature. During these explorations, I do analog photography. I love the technical details of doing analog photography. There is a collection of my photos [here](https://pooyasf.github.io/photos/){:target="_self"}. They were taken while I was traveling to different parts of Iran.
