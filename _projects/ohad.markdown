The project was for OHAD, a company that makes medical equipment. One of the devices was a multifunctional timer. This device has been designed to be highly reliable for operating theaters and includes a clock, thermometer, and humidity sensor. The second device is an alarm panel that connects to other devices in the Operating theater and indicates their status. It should handle noise on input signals. 

In this project, I designed circuits and firmware for these two devices, both of which were successfully mass produced.
