I had cofounded Wisperd. Wisperd's main goal was to offer quality solution for public spaces like subway , airports and shopping malls. Our Wisperd Q is a tablet like mini kiosk that is cloud based. So from managment point of view you could organize and monitor all devices through internet. They are Linux based. My main role in Wisperd was managing reasearch and development of hardware , software and design.
